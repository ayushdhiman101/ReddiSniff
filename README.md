## Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

Before you start, ensure that you have the following:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have JDK 11 or higher installed on your system.
- **Spring Boot**: This project is built with Spring Boot, so you'll need to have that setup.
- **Reddit API Access**: This tool interacts with Reddit's API, so you'll need a Reddit account and a registered app to obtain an `accessToken` (OAuth token). You can use your personal Reddit `accessToken` for authentication.

## How It Works ü§ñ

The **Reddit Scraper API** uses the Reddit API to fetch data from subreddits. This data is retrieved through a **GET** request to Reddit's API endpoint.

### Process:
1. **Authentication**: This version uses a **personal access token** for authentication, so there's no OAuth flow.
2. **Requesting Data**: A dynamically constructed URL is used to fetch posts based on the parameters passed to the function.
3. **Parsing JSON Response**: The response is parsed into a list of `ScrapedPost` objects, which include details about the posts and comments.
